// Example of how the uploaded files are processed:
const exampleUploadedFile = {
  file: new File(["content"], "example.pdf", { type: "application/pdf" }),
  name: "example.pdf",
  size: 1024000, // 1MB
  type: "application/pdf",
  content: "base64ContentString...", // Converted from file
};

// Example of the enhanced email attachments array:
const exampleAttachments = [
  // Policy documents (from database)
  {
    filename: "policy_certificate.pdf",
    content: "base64FromDatabase...",
    content_type: "application/pdf",
  },
  // Application documents (from database)
  {
    filename: "id_document.jpg",
    content: "base64FromDatabase...",
    content_type: "image/jpeg",
  },
  // Uploaded files (from device)
  {
    filename: "additional_document.pdf",
    content: "base64FromDevice...",
    content_type: "application/pdf",
  },
];
