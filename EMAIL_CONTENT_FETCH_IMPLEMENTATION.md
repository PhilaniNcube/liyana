# Email Content Fetching Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented functionality to fetch email content from the Resend API using `email.resend_id` and display it in the EmailHistory component across applications, loans, and policies.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Email Queries (`lib/queries/emails.ts`)

- **Added `getEmailsForApplicationWithDetails`**: Fetches application emails with full content from Resend API
- **Added `getEmailsForLoanWithDetails`**: Fetches loan emails with full content from Resend API  
- **Enhanced existing `getEmailsForPolicyWithDetails`**: Already existed and working correctly

All these functions use the existing `fetchEmailDetailsFromResend` function which:
- Uses `resend.emails.get(resendId)` to fetch full email content
- Returns structured `EmailDetails` including subject, from, to, html/text content, and status
- Handles errors gracefully by returning `null` if fetch fails

### 2. Updated API Route (`app/api/emails/history/route.ts`)

- **Changed imports**: Now imports the new functions with details instead of basic email records
- **Enhanced functionality**: API now returns emails with full content details instead of just metadata
- **Backward compatible**: Same API endpoint, enhanced response format

### 3. Application Page Enhancements

#### Page Component (`app/dashboard/applications/[id]/page.tsx`)
- **Added import**: `getEmailsForApplicationWithDetails`
- **Fetch email history**: Added parallel fetch alongside existing data fetching
- **Pass to client**: Updated props to include `emailHistory`

#### Client Component (`app/dashboard/applications/[id]/client.tsx`)
- **Added imports**: `EmailHistory` component and `EmailWithDetails` type
- **Updated interface**: Added `emailHistory: EmailWithDetails[]` to props
- **Enhanced emails tab**: Changed from single card to two-column layout with send/history split
- **Added EmailHistory**: Now displays complete email history with content

### 4. Loan Page Enhancements

#### Page Component (`app/dashboard/loans/[id]/page.tsx`)
- **Added import**: `getEmailsForLoanWithDetails`
- **Fetch email history**: Added fetch for loan email history
- **Pass to component**: Updated LoanEmailTab props to include `emailHistory`

#### LoanEmailTab Component (`app/dashboard/loans/[id]/_components/loan-email-tab.tsx`)
- **Added imports**: `EmailHistory` component and `EmailWithDetails` type
- **Updated interface**: Added `emailHistory: EmailWithDetails[]` to props
- **Enhanced layout**: Changed to two-column grid with send/history split
- **Added EmailHistory**: Now displays complete email history with content

### 5. Policy Pages (Already Working)

The policy pages were already using `getEmailsForPolicyWithDetails` and displaying the `EmailHistory` component correctly.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Complete Email Content Display**
- Subject lines
- From/To addresses  
- Email status (sent, delivered, opened, etc.)
- Full HTML and text content
- Creation timestamps

### 2. **Expandable Email History**
- Collapsible cards for each email
- Preview shows subject and timestamp
- Expand to see full content and metadata
- Truncated Resend ID display

### 3. **Error Handling**
- Graceful fallback when Resend API is unavailable
- Shows "Email details could not be loaded from Resend" message
- Continues to show basic email metadata even if content fetch fails

### 4. **Consistent UI Across All Entity Types**
- Applications, loans, and policies all have same email interface
- Two-column layout: Send emails (left) | Email history (right)
- Responsive design that stacks on mobile

## Technical Details

### Resend API Integration
```typescript
// Uses the existing fetchEmailDetailsFromResend function
const email = await resend.emails.get(resendId);

// Returns structured data:
{
  id: string;
  to: string[];
  from: string;
  subject: string;
  html: string;
  text: string;
  created_at: string;
  last_event: string;
}
```

### API Response Format
The `/api/emails/history` endpoint now returns:
```typescript
EmailWithDetails[] = {
  // Basic email record from database
  id: number;
  resend_id: string;
  profile_id: string;
  application_id: number | null;
  loan_id: number | null;
  policy_id: number | null;
  created_at: string;
  
  // Enhanced content from Resend API
  details?: {
    id: string;
    to: string[];
    from: string;
    subject: string;
    html: string;
    text: string;
    created_at: string;
    last_event: string;
  }
}
```

## Testing

A test script has been created at `test-email-content-fetch.js` to verify the functionality:
- Tests all three entity types (applications, loans, policies)
- Validates API responses
- Checks content availability
- Provides detailed console output

## Environment Requirements

- **RESEND_API_KEY**: Must be configured for content fetching to work
- **Existing email records**: Must have emails in the `resend_emails` table with valid `resend_id` values

## Benefits

1. **Complete Email Audit Trail**: Users can see full email history with content
2. **Better Customer Service**: Support staff can see exactly what was sent to customers
3. **Improved Transparency**: Full visibility into email communications
4. **Content Verification**: Ability to verify email content and delivery status
5. **Troubleshooting**: Can diagnose email delivery issues using status information

## Future Enhancements

- Email content search functionality
- Email template management
- Bulk email operations
- Email scheduling
- Advanced filtering and sorting
